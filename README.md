Predicting CHD using a Logistic Model
-------------------------------------

We use this application to predict the 10-year risk of Coronary Heart Disease. CHD is a disease of the blood vessels supplying the heart. 
It has been the leading cause of death worldwide and high levels of risk factors increase the probability of experiencing such a disease.

In this application, we have used a logistic regression model to predict the probability a patient will experience CHD within 10 years from this examination.
We have taken into account demographic, behavioral, medical history risk factors and other features. 
The most dangerous risk factors according to several past studies are smoking, cholesterol, glucose and systolic blood pressure.
